Step 7 Reflect: When to Use a Remote Repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

If I was collaborating with other developers on a project I would want us to all
share our work on a remote repository. I also like the idea that by pushing my
work remotely I create a backup with copies local and remote. Another benefit is
to the github community which can see my project, borrow anything usefull, and 
contribute if they so desire.
