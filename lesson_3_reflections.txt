Step 7 Reflect: When to Use a Remote Repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

If I was collaborating with other developers on a project I would want us to all
share our work on a remote repository. I also like the idea that by pushing my
work remotely I create a backup with copies local and remote. Another benefit is
to the github community which can see my project, borrow anything usefull, and 
contribute if they so desire.


Step 10 Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I wouldn't want the branch I'm working on to change automatically without my
knowledge. It would be like developing in quicksand without any kind of sure footing.


Step 14 Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Use fork on github to copy a github repository from another user into your github
directory. That way you can make changes without affecting the original repository.

Use clone to copy a github repository to your local computer. This allows you to make
changes that only you can see until you're ready to share the changes by pushing them
out to github

A branch is a labeled sequence of commits within a repository. They are used to keep
track of changes you make to your repository. Changes on a branch can be pushed to
a github repository for sharing. Any changes to a branch on the github repository that
collaborators have shared can be pulled to your local repository.
