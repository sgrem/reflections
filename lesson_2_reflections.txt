What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository a .git directory is created. This is a hidden directory
that contains the control information necesary for managing the repository. It is also
used to contain the index (staging area) and all of the commits. The commits are
snapshots taken of your project and can be used to back out from bugs and to try
safely develop and try out new features.
